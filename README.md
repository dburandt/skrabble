# skrabble

a simple tool for dynamic data mocking

## Setup

```sh
npm install skrabble
```

## Usage

How skrabble works in two lines of code:

```javascript
const skrabble = require(skrabble);

console.log(skrabble('name')); // 'John Smith'
```

That's it! Skrabble will return an empty string, `''`, for any invalid inputs;

## Acknowledgements

- skrabble is heavily influence by and uses much of its data from [faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/)
